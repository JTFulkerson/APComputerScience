This is an appealing story.
One day, a hermit brother about to leave for town went to a brother who lived nearby and who had continual compunction. He said to his fervent neighbor, "Please do me the kindness, brother, of taking care of my garden until my return." The other replied, "Believe me, brother, I will do my best not to neglect it." After the brother's departure, he said to himself, Now take care of this garden. And from evening until dawn he stood in psalmody, ceaselessly shedding tears. He prayed the same way for the entire day. Coming home late, the brother found that hedgehogs had ravaged his garden.
He said, "God forgive you, brother, for not taking care of my garden."
The other answered, "God knows I did my best to keep it, and I hope through God's mercy that the little garden will bear fruit."
The brother said, "But it has been completely destroyed!"
The other replied, "I know, but I have confidence in God that it will flower again."
But he was speaking of the effort of his continual tears, the weeping for one's sins in the hope of salvation, and of the garden of his heart, watered by him and in full flower.
